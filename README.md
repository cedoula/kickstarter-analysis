# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns.

## Overview of Project

### Purpose
The purpose of this project is to perform analysis with Excel on Kickstarter data to uncover trends and help our client to adjust its future campaign projects for the best results.

## Analysis and Challenges

### Analysis of Parent Categrory Outcomes

Since the client is planning a campaign for a play in the U.S. we have taken a look at the Kikckstarter campaigns done in the U.S. Out of the 3038 campaigns done 912 were for the theater category which make it the highest in therm of campaign numbers.
As the following pictures show, Theater is also the most successful category with 525 successful campaigns lead.

### Analysis of Subcategory Outcomes

Out of all the Kickstarter campaigns in the U.S., 671 were for plays and over 61% of those campaigns were successful. This makes the plays as the most successful category for Kickstarter campaigns in the U.S.

### Analysis of Outcomes Based On Launch Date

For this analysis, we are focusing on the campaigns for the category "Theater".
We have produced the PivotChart named "Theater Outcomes Based on Launch Date" from the Kickstarter data. The chart is representing the number of successful, failed and canceled campaigns according the month when the campaign is launched. The chart is filtered with the parent category "theater" and we are also able to filter by year if we want to focus on a particular period of time.
We obtain the chart below considering all years for the analysis.

## Descriptive Statistics

The data shows that failed Kickstarter campaigns have much higher fundraising goals than the successful Kickstarter campaigns.
The average successful goal is about $5,000, so the client would need to stay in this range to achieve a successful campaign.
Mean and Median values of the pledged amounts of the failed Kickstarter campaigns are much lower than those for the successful campaigns so the high fundraising goal is not the only reason why those campaigns failed. Other factors need to be taken into account.


## Great Britain Musical Analysis

From these plots, we can see that the mean campaign goal is around £4,000. This is outside of the range of outliers for amount pledged, so the client should probably try to get her play produced for less than £4,000. Half of the campaign goals are less than £2,000, which is just over the 3rd quartile for amounts pledged, so we would not advise a campaign goal higher than £2,000.
